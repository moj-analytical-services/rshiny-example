# RShiny app template

This repo is a template for an RShiny app, which will run on the Analytical Platform.

This version of the template is for:

* R 4.0.5
* Renv packaging

If you want R 3.5.1 and Conda packaging you will need to use the `R-351` branch.

See instructions: https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/rshiny-app.html#use-the-app-template

Once you've copied this template, delete the contents of this README up to this point, and complete the suggested bits below.
